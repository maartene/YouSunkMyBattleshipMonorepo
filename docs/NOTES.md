## DONE
- Migrate the iOS app to use a cells property instead of a function. This makes keeping the view in sync with the model much easier. The 'force update' can also go.
- Decide on how to get events from other (CPU player): polling, WS or a custom NIO protocol?
- Getting defeated should place you in the finished state too.
- Refactor the backend
- Add tests for limited number of moves for CPU
